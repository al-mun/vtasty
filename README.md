# Recipe app built with React

This simple recipe app uses React state management through hooks, as well as components and props.  

# Use of useState (react hooks)

-The state of the modal will update based on which recipe the user selects.
-Items displayed based on the category selected by the user.

# Use of components

-App is split into many different components including, the nav, menu, data (containing item information), and modal (where data is displayed).

# Use of props

-The data (recipe info) is first imported to App.js and then passed down to the Menu component. 
-The data is then passed down to the Modal component.
